0.75    2016-02-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        [Bug fixes]

        - When launching Riap 'call' request to functions to get example result,
          didn't use full URL, so peri-doc fails to render example results.

        - When getting function metadata, didn't use 'normalize_metadata'
          setting of Perinci::Access, so we didn't get _orig_args_as &
          _orig_result_naked keys. This caused rendering to be incorrect.

        - peri-doc: Avoid dereference error when we only generate doc for a
          single function.

        - Don't show sub's export information if unknown. Previously peri-doc
          showed 'not exported by default but exportable' but this might be
          wrong depending on the package settings. Now by default we don't show
          export information at all, unless export information is supplied in
          the 'export' attribute.


0.74    2015-12-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR

          Data::Dump::SortKeys' 0.04 $REMOVE_PRAGMAS option.

	  exported by default but exportable, never exported).

           (Perinci-Sub-To-Text, Perinci-To-Text, Perinci-Sub-To-POD,
